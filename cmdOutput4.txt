Recommend me movies similar to Hamlet and Othello!

entity: Hamlet
entity: Othello

Considering what you like (Hamlet, Othello), how about trying Grumpier Old Men, Waiting to Exhale, Heat? They fit the bill because some movies were published in the same year and the genres are overlapping. The details about the movies are shown as follows: the publication date of all movies is 1995 and the genres of all movie are Romance, Crime, Action, Thriller, Comedy, Drama. Furthermore, I have found some more movies you'd might like based on embeddings: Henry V and Richard III. Enjoy!
